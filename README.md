Nezaya's Language Manager - By me. This will prevent you from ever sending someone a tell in a language they do not understand. Alias nlm help for details on use.

AuleTattoos - A beautiful and useful script by our very own Micharoj, now retired. Will show you tattoos you are missing. Also works on others, very useful for novice aides

zData - This is a bashing tracker by I think Zulah. Alias zbash to show places you have hunted and how much gold/XP you got from them.
