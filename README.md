AK 8.6 - Current Release (5/16/2025)

AuleTattoos - A beautiful and useful script by our very own Micharoj, now retired. Will show you tattoos you are missing. Also works on others, very useful for novice aides

FraxTrax - A popup window that tracks fractures for warriors.

Nezaya's Language Manager - By me. This will prevent you from ever sending someone a tell in a language they do not understand. Alias nlm help for details on use.

zData - This is a bashing tracker by I think Zulah. Alias zbash to show places you have hunted and how much gold/XP you got from them.

Warmap by Sela - This very pretty tool will allow you to see a visual map of conquest with color. Alias warmap to pull it up. You MUST be a member of the clan TLOS for this to work.
